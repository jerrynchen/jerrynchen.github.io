# ðŸ§‘ About Me

<div class='paper-box-text' style="font-size: larger;" markdown="1">

I am now in my second year of Phd. in data science and analysis (DSA) at HKUST, advised by [Jia li](https://sites.google.com/view/lijia) and [Yangqiu Song](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=MdQZ-q8AAAAJ&hl=zh-CN&oi=ao).

I got my master's degree from Peking University, majored in computer science, supervised by [Yuexian Zou](https://web.pkusz.edu.cn/adsp/), and got my bachelor's degree from Beijing University of Posts and Telecommunications. I was employed  as a research intern by Alibaba Damo Academy, Microsoft research and  Tencent AI Lab, worked closely with [Daxin Jiang](https://scholar.google.com/citations?user=N-wAHCoAAAAJ&hl=zh-CN), [Linjun Shou](https://www.microsoft.com/en-us/research/people/lisho/), [Yan Wang](https://libertywing.github.io/yanwang.github.io/). 

 My research interests focus on nlp, including question answering, cross-lingual understanding, dialog generation and multi-modal fusion.  
Currently, my works now are focusing on **Large Language Models** and **Cross-Lingual language reasoning**. I also have some experiences in designing or pre-trainig large language models, including chinese, English and multi-lingual. I am  familiar with speech and audio processing (a little, LOL)



In my free time, I enjoy swimming, playing board games. Additionally, I occasionally post random thoughts and share paper details on [Zhihu](https://www.zhihu.com/people/chen-nuo-8-79-20).
